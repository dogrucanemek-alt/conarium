# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added — Receipt v0.1 (verifiable audit receipts)

- Ed25519 key management (`src/keys.ts`) with `.keyid` sidecars
- Portable receipt schema + JCS canonicalize + hash (`src/receipt.ts`)
- Independent offline verifier: `bin/conarium-verify.mjs`
- Transparency-log anchor interface + scheduler (`src/anchor.ts`; Memory sink for tests, Rekor-shaped sink stub)
- Spec: `docs/RECEIPT-SPEC.md`

### Changed

- Audit signing is **fail-closed**: without `CONARIUM_AUDIT_HMAC_KEY` or
  `CONARIUM_AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY`, writes throw unless `CONARIUM_AUDIT_UNSIGNED=1`
  is set explicitly (was: silent skip). Capability is checked at **construction**
  as well as `log()` (GATE 1 / F3).
- Audit entries may carry Ed25519 `sig` alongside legacy HMAC `signature`.
- `validateChain` treats missing `sig` / foreign `keyId` as out-of-scope (legacy /
  rotation), not tampering (GATE 1 / F1).

### Fixed (GATE 1 follow-up / F5)

- `validateChain` Ed25519 **contiguity**: after the first signed line, missing
  `sig` is corrupt; foreign `keyId` accepted when present in the trust store.
- Multi-keyId trust store: current signing pubkey + `CONARIUM_AUDIT_TRUST_PUBKEYS`.
- See `docs/superpowers/TODO-gate1-f4.md` (F4 text; implemented as F5).
